Proxy filtering - Keeping the kids safe. Based on the kidsafe program by Stewart Watkiss

I used wingate before and thought this was a good proxy filtering system, allowing me to block and filter sites as i please, kidsafe is a python script and php front end that intergrates with squid3 proxy service for linux computers.
